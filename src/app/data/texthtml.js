        <p> I know, it’s not really London. But “Gatwick Airport to Alagna” just doesn’t have the same ring to it. I had arrived with my bike the day before. Pedalling out of that airport and straight into the British countryside was simply awesome. I felt like James Bond. It was honestly one of the best moments of the trip, right off the bat.</p>
        <img src="alagna/1-2.jpg"/>
        <p> I was now in the nearby town of Redhill, prepared to officially start the journey. In true UK fashion, it rained for most of the day. It wasn’t heavy rain, and there were breaks, but it was certainly persistent. At one point I ended up seeking shelter in a pub, where I enjoyed fish and chips, mushy peas, and a beer. Hard to get more British than that.</p>
        <img src="alagna/1-3.jpg"/>
        <p> I went into this trip with the goal of stealth camping as much as possible, and was keen to get it going immediately. But the weather, as well as my jet lag, made me reconsider. I ended up staying at a hotel.</p>

        <img src="alagna/2-1.jpg"/>
        <p>I got into my second day on the road. The rain had stopped, and I could take in the sights and sounds of the countryside a bit better. There were a couple hills early on, but I shifted into a low gear and made fairly light work of them. It helped that I was on some incredibly peaceful roads with hardly any cars.</p>
        <img src="alagna/2-2.jpg"/>
        <p>So far, my route had contained occasional sections of unpaved forest trails. As I approached another forest in the afternoon, I was ready to get back on the dirt. But for whatever reason, this particular trail was extremely muddy. At first I was able to skirt around the bad sections, but they soon became unavoidable. By the time I got out, my tires were absolutely covered in mud. </p>  
        <img src="alagna/2-3.jpg"/>
        <p>A short while later, I found myself on another dirt path, pedalling uphill. As I ascended, the view opened up into a sweeping panorama of the coast. Then suddenly, I was surrounded by sheep! This stretch was absolutely epic – the photo doesn’t do it justice. It and the muddy forest probably made up about 5 kilometres combined, but they added such an unexpected, adventurous twist to the day.</p>
        <img src="alagna/2-4.jpg"/>
        <p>Before I knew it, I was already on a ferry to France, saying goodbye to the UK. It’s a shame I couldn’t stay longer; time constraints were the main factor preventing that. I hope to go back one day. I would especially like to cycle in Wales.</p>

        <img src="alagna/3-1.jpg"/>
        <p>I was now in the French port of Dieppe, where I would begin my journey into mainland Europe. As I ordered my first croissant, I realized that I hadn't spoken French since high school, and consequently, it had seriously deteriorated. Not that it was ever any good... Anyway, I liked Dieppe. It wasn’t picturesque, but it still had a certain charm.</p>
        <img src="alagna/3-2.jpg"/>
        <p>As soon as I got out of Dieppe, there was practically no one else on the road. It was so peaceful. I was following the coast for the next little while; my surroundings alternated between tiny villages and vast, empty fields. I was also now following the EuroVelo route network, and quickly noticed an advantage: navigation was a breeze. The route was signposted at almost every intersection.</p>  
        <img src="alagna/3-3.jpg"/>
        <p>I had started late today, so it was already around 6:00 pm when I reached the town of Mers-les-Bains. My plan was to have dinner here, then push on and find a spot to stealth camp. The first step went flawlessly, but everything fell apart afterwards. I spent around three hours searching for a spot, without any success. The landscape wasn’t ideal – lots of open fields and not much tree cover. However, I was also putting up a lot of mental resistance to the idea of stealth camping. I started worrying about what-ifs when I needed to just toughen up and put my tent down.</p>
        <p>Eventually, it got dark, started raining, and to top it all off, I stepped in this bizarre sludgy substance while investigating a potential spot. That was the last straw. Despite the amount of searching I had done, I had never gotten too far from Mers-les-Bains. So I headed back there and checked into the cheapest hotel I could find. Exhausted and dejected by the events of the past few hours, I started to doubt whether I was truly capable of wild camping on this trip.</p>

        <img src="alagna/4-1.jpg"/>
        <p>A good sleep had revived me after last night’s disaster. I was now more determined than ever to successfully stealth camp. First though, there was a whole day ahead of me. Today’s conditions weren't great; the sky was completely grey, and it was raining on and off. However, this created a very moody atmosphere which, in my opinion, fit the scenery well.</p>
        <img src="alagna/4-2.jpg"/>
        <p>After cycling inland for a bit, I popped back out on the water at the resort town of Cayeux-sur-Mer. Unsurprisingly, this place was deserted – it was a pretty bad time for a beach vacation. I continued along the coast for a while. The views began to remind me of Iona Beach, my favourite ride to do back in Vancouver. It was a strange moment. I realized how far away from there I was, though I also couldn't help but feel some sort of familiarity.</p>  
        <img src="alagna/4-3.jpg"/>
        <p>Later on I reached a town called Saint-Valery-sur-Somme. There were actually signs of life here, which was comforting, but it was also just a very nice, quaint town. This marked the point where I would officially leave the coast and start heading up the Somme, the first of many rivers/canals my route followed. I grabbed dinner at a supermarket and enjoyed it by the water.</p>
        <p>With the day winding down, it was time to tackle camping. Again I spent a good deal of time searching, and again I struggled with the mental barrier. But eventually, I summoned the courage to commit to a spot. The exact location isn’t shown. I’ll just say that it was inside of a bush, in what I wouldn’t call an unpopulated area. Not the smoothest operation; even so, I didn't get found. And what mattered most was that I had gotten it done.</p>

        <p>Stealth camping is, in many ways, challenging – not to mention uncomfortable – but the feeling of cycling away the next morning is one of its greatest rewards. I’d describe it as a combination of relief and triumph. I was in high spirits. Unfortunately, it had started to rain just as I was packing up, so I stopped to dry out my tent at the first opportunity. This became a frequent occurrence in the early days of the trip, and it was always a bit of a buzzkill.</p>
        <img src="alagna/5-2.jpg"/>
        <p>It was another serene day of cycling, spent entirely on a path beside the Somme. The river around here was extremely slow-moving, and looked more like a marsh at times. What I remember most was the constant chirping of birds. Not in an annoying way though – in fact, quite the opposite. It was like one of those nature relaxation recordings.</p>  
        <img src="alagna/5-3.jpg"/>
        <p>By the late afternoon, I had reached the city of Amiens. I spent some time checking it out, but it just wasn’t that enjoyable. For me (and I would realize this later), cities are not great when I’m on the move. First, I’m quite paranoid about theft, so any attraction that requires me to leave my bike unattended is a no-go. Then, navigating all the streets is draining, especially if I've already been cycling for hours. I’ve realized that the best way for me to enjoy a city is to book a hotel and explore it on foot.</p>
        <img src="alagna/5-4.jpg"/>
        <p>To close out the day, I executed another stealth camp; this time a lot more cleanly. I had gotten far enough from Amiens that it was dead quiet again, and I was able to find a well-hidden spot close to the bike path. To my surprise, I wasn’t having difficulties falling asleep while stealth camping. The whole thing was still nerve-wracking, but once it got dark and I was in my tent, I'd be out pretty quick. Maybe I was just that tired.</p>
        </>,
        <>
        <img src="alagna/6-1.jpg" />
        <p> I followed the Somme for a little bit further until it was time to turn off and begin heading north, towards Belgium. I was leaving the riverside path, but that wouldn’t be much of a problem. It was replaced with some of the most generous bike lanes I had ever seen. Besides, this was a winding, scenic route. Cars were few and far between.</p>
        <p>A few hours into the day, my bike began to make a subtle, yet noticeable squeaking noise. My first thought was that it had to be related to the chain. However, after a thorough cleaning, nothing had changed. I was annoyed – not just by the noise, but also by my inability to identify its origin. It only happened while I was pedalling, and seemed to be almost at random. This made it insanely hard to tell where it was coming from. Not wanting any delays though, I decided to live with it for the time being.</p>  
        <img src="alagna/6-2.jpg"/>
        <p>The route I was now following was actually called “La Véloroute de la Mémoire”. That’s because I was going through a lot of historic World War I sites. The various memorials and monuments made for some interesting roadside attractions. Also, I couldn’t help but feel like there was a certain sombre atmosphere throughout the day. It was as if, even though over 100 years had passed, the effects of the war were still weighing on the area. Maybe it was just the weather.</p>
        <img src="alagna/6-3.jpg"/>
        <p>Eventually, the sun began to set. After scouting Google Maps, I identified a small forest up ahead, close to the route. Once I got there, everything looked good; I set up camp for the third night in a row. But later, while I was in the tent, a vehicle pulled into the forest. <i>It’s over</i>, I thought. My life flashed before my eyes. Fortunately, I had set up far enough away from the access road that I was hidden. The vehicle idled for about a minute before, to my enormous relief, it left. My guess is this was a farmer making their final rounds of the day, but I’ll never know (and for that I am glad).</p>

        <img src="alagna/7-1.jpg"/>
        <p>There was no rain overnight, which was good, but it made an appearance as soon as I started cycling. This was becoming regular by now: it would rain in the morning, then clear up in the afternoon. Getting soaked wasn’t good for morale, so I tried to seek cover as much as I could. Sometimes it wasn’t possible, though. And when I did find shelter, I would soon get bored of waiting. The silver lining was that the rain was never super heavy.</p>
        <img src="alagna/7-2.jpg"/>
        <p>In the city of Arras I got my first and only flat tire of the trip, thanks to a piece of glass. I had a spare tube, and before leaving, I’d actually practiced replacing one to prepare for this situation. I still wasn’t confident, though. Add to that the rain, and the fact that it happened so “conveniently” in a city… I decided to go to a bike shop.</p>  
        <p>But as luck would have it, I arrived just as the shop had closed for lunch. I waited it out, stubbornly (and lazily) still refusing to fix the flat myself. Finally, they reopened and took care of it. They actually had to reseal the tire because it had been fully punctured, so maybe my decision was for the best. Still, this had cost me a lot of time, and some money, too.</p>
        <img src="alagna/7-3.jpg"/>
        <p> A couple hours of cycling later, I came across a familiar flag. It turns out I was passing through the Canadian Vimy Ridge Memorial Park. To be honest, I had absolutely no idea this was on my route. But it was a pleasant surprise! They had a visitors centre, where it was comforting and even a bit surreal to speak with the Canadian staff in English. The memorial itself was gigantic. It was the most impressive I had seen thus far, and I promise that’s not me being biased.</p>
        <img src="alagna/7-4.jpg"/>
        <p>My original plan was to camp somewhere between Lens and Lille, but due to the flat tire debacle, it was already evening by the time I got to Lens. I checked into a hotel. I felt some disappointment, since I had wanted to camp all the way to Brussels. But I was also just worn out. After a much-needed shower, I walked into town and attempted to watch a live football match. RC Lens were playing at home, and they were actually doing very well that season. Maybe because of that, though, it seemed the entire city was at the game. Tickets were sold out.</p>

        <img src="alagna/8-1.jpg"/>
        <p> It was time to do some laundry. My original plan was to hand wash my clothes in hotels, but I tried that on the first day and it was just a hassle. Plus, it didn’t even really work. In France, there were these washer/dryer stations in practically every decently-sized town. Sure, they cost a little, but it was so worth it. As a bonus, they were usually attached to a supermarket, so I could go and get food while my clothes were being washed.</p>
        <img src="alagna/8-2.jpg"/>
        <p>Soon, I was beside another canal, which I followed all the way into the city of Lille. Or more specifically, the Lille Metropole. I didn’t actually go into Lille’s centre – something I regret a lot. Instead, I only experienced the giant urban area surrounding it, and while there was great cycling infrastructure throughout, it was pretty dull. There were also a couple parts which struck me as being a bit sketchy (for Western Europe’s standards). </p>  
        <img src="alagna/8-3.jpg"/>
        <p>I had hardly made it out of the Metropole when, all of a sudden, I found myself in Belgium! This was the first country of the trip to which I had never been. I also had a special plan for accommodation here: Welcome To My Garden. This is a Belgium-based website/service, where people offer their gardens as free, overnight campsites. Except you must be “slow travelling” – that is, by bike or on foot – and obviously, you have to get permission. I discovered WTMG while planning and decided I would try it in Belgium, where it was most popular.</p>
        <p>A garden had been found for tonight; my host’s name was Bernard. As I headed towards the address given to me, I was both excited and nervous. But I never could have expected what was to follow. Upon arriving, I was surprised to see a tent already up in the yard, as well as a bunch of people. It turns out my stay coincided with some sort of family party that Bernard was hosting. Without a second thought, I was invited to join. There was food, and, this being Belgium, a generous amount of beer.</p>
        <p>My French abilities were pushed to their limits, and I often had to fall back to English (luckily, some of the others could speak it). We talked about a lot of things, including my trip, for which they thought I was crazy. Although at one point, Bernard brought me into the garage and showed me this contraption – basically a go-kart with a propeller – and casually told me he flew it over the fields. <i>That</i> was crazy.</p>
        <p>Bernard and his family were some of the friendliest people I had ever met. Unfortunately, it didn’t occur to me to take any photos with them (or any of my other hosts, for that matter). I regret that a lot.</p>
        </>,
        <>
        <img src="alagna/9-1.jpg"/>
        <p>A huge plus of WTMG was that I didn't have to wake up at the crack of dawn and hurriedly pack up. Instead, I had a nice, gentle start to the day. I thanked Bernard for everything, said goodbye, and continued on. Today, I wanted to get as close to Brussels as possible, and hopefully find another garden. That would mean covering a lot more kilometres, but I had warmed up by now. I felt confident it could be done. Then, tomorrow, I’d take my first official rest day in the capital.</p>
        <img src="alagna/9-2.jpg"/>
        <p>Belgium’s cycling infrastructure was just as good as France’s. I rode on bike paths for most of the day; otherwise, I was on quiet backroads. There were also many more cyclists here – specifically, road cyclists. I saw a ton of kitted-out riders over the course of the day (most of them were zooming past me). It was a nice change, because up to this point I often felt like I was the only cyclist for miles around. There were no other bicycle tourists though, unfortunately.</p>  
        <img src="alagna/9-3.jpg"/>
        <p>For lunch, I stopped at a friterie (Belgian fast food, basically) in a village called Flobecq. I ordered, ate, then went up to pay, as is the norm in these types of places. But here, I ran into trouble: they only accepted cash or, bizarrely, e-transfers from Belgian bank accounts. Up to this point, I had paid with a credit card everywhere, and foolishly, I still had not withdrawn a single Euro. There was one ATM in the village, but for some reason, it refused to accept my card. So, in the end, I got a free lunch – not a guilt-free one, though. This was 100% my fault. I did the least I could and left a 5-star review. </p>
        <img src="alagna/9-4.jpg"/>
        <p>By the end of the day, I had knocked out nearly all the kilometres remaining between me and Brussels. I say "nearly" because I had found a garden just outside of the city. My host was named Benoit, and he was another great guy. We had a nice chat, during which he spoiled me with Belgian chocolates and craft beer. Benoit was also a cyclist, but a road cyclist – and a serious one at that. Unfortunately, at that moment he was dealing with an injury, keeping him off the bike. He worked in tech and had studied computer science, so we had that in common, too. I also got a rundown of Brussels: the different neighbourhoods, things to do, etc. It was once again a fantastic experience.</p>
        </>,
        <>
        <img src="alagna/10-1.jpg"/>
        <p>Benoit needed to go to work early in the morning, but he had generously told me that I could sleep in and leave later. So, having already said thanks and goodbye last night, I enjoyed another gentle rise. Then, I cycled into Brussels. This was one of the biggest cities of the trip, but my ride was surprisingly quiet. I was on a canal and mostly going through industrial zones. The peacefulness lasted all the way to the city centre; then, all of a sudden, the hustle and bustle emerged.</p>
        <p>WTMG had been great so far, but now that I was in a city as large as Brussels, I wanted to try staying in a hostel. I booked one online, and immediately headed there to check in. Upon arriving, however, I was informed that it was far too early. In hindsight, I’m not sure why I failed to take this into account. Either I wasn’t thinking, or I simply didn’t know. Anyway, I was now stuck with my bike for the next several hours, so I decided to ride it around the city.</p>
        <img src="alagna/10-2.jpg"/>
        <p>As I rolled over the old town’s cobblestone streets, my bike sounded like some sort of angry rodent—the mysterious squeaking that started on Day 6 had gotten really bad. I’d deduced that it was being caused by riding over any sort of bump, though I was still clueless as to a fix. This was a perfect opportunity to take it into a shop and get it looked at. But inexplicably, I did not do that. Instead, I endured the sounds throughout the day, driving myself up the wall in the process.</p>  
        <img src="alagna/10-3.jpg"/>
        <p>When I could finally check into the hostel, everyone in my room was out. So, I decided to go back and explore Brussels on foot. It was a great city to walk around – very clean, with lots of cool shops and green spaces. The weather certainly could have been nicer, though. Also, the one museum I was interested in, the Comic Art Museum, was closed for the day. Still, I visited many of Benoit’s suggestions, including Manneken Pis, a fountain which depicts a guy pissing. Scratched that one off my bucket list.</p>
        <p>After dinner and a Belgian waffle (dessert!), I returned to the hostel. The room was now full; most of the others had come back together. Some of them were going to a concert that night, and they invited me to join. However, at this point, I was exhausted. I had somewhat violated the definition of a rest day with all the biking and walking. So, I declined the offer and went to bed. Yeah, boring, I know. </p>
        </>,
        <>
        <img src="alagna/11-1.jpg"/>
        <p> I had enjoyed Brussels, but I was now quite eager to get back on the road. On the way out of the city centre, I stopped at the Grand Place again. It was much less crowded this morning (and the lighting was better). Leaving town, I didn’t have the tranquility or security of the canal path; I was following one of the busiest streets in the city. Fortunately, it was mostly bike-laned, and where it wasn’t, there were detours set up for cyclists.</p>
        <img src="alagna/11-2.jpg"/>
        <p>My route zigzagged through a giant woodland just outside of Brussels called the Sonian Forest. In contrast to the traffic of the city, it was just lovely. I rode along well-maintained paths, surrounded by towering trees and complete silence. There were some sections that had been landscaped into gardens or parks, and these were beautiful as well.</p>
        <img src="alagna/11-3.jpg"/>
        <p>Later, I reached a town called Wavre, where I was struck by the unusually high number of kids on the street. It must be lunch break at the local school, I thought, as I continued on. About 20 minutes later, however, I once again found myself surrounded by children. How many schools did this town have? Then, I slowly realized that I was in the exact same place as before. Somehow (to this day, I still don’t know exactly what happened), I had managed to cycle in a big circle. While I missed a turn or took the wrong one nearly every day, this was by far the strangest navigational error of the trip.</p>  
        <img src="alagna/11-4.jpg"/>
        <p>The rest of the day brought some pleasant cycling as I ventured deeper into the Belgian countryside. By dinnertime, I found myself in a very rural area, with only two options: a friterie or a restaurant. I tried the friterie first, but as I suspected, it was cash-only. Here’s the crazy thing: I still hadn’t withdrawn any. Simply inexcusable. I had at least made sure to check before ordering this time. Anyway, the restaurant was my last hope. But when I got there, I was greeted with a sign that translated to “permanently closed”. Google Maps had betrayed me at the worst possible time!</p>
        <p>Tonight’s garden was in the area, so I decided to just call it in. I also decided to hide the fact that I hadn’t been able to find dinner. Even with my track record of extremely generous hosts, I felt ashamed to bring it up, and I was prepared to dine on my leftover snacks. But my host – once again named Bernard – was an absolute saviour. Almost immediately, he offered me an entire, multi-course meal. Then, as if that wasn’t enough, he told me that since the grass hadn’t been cut in the garden, I could sleep in an empty room of the house—and have a shower.</p>
        <p>In the relatively short time I spent with him, Bernard had quite an inspirational effect on me. Besides being a bicycle tourist himself, he was also volunteering to map long-distance bike routes in Wallonia (the French part of Belgium). This involved GIS, which he also used in his job. I had vaguely heard of GIS before, but I didn’t really know what it involved. After learning about it from Bernard, I realized it was working with maps, and, well, maps are cool. My interest was piqued. When I got back from the trip, I decided to enroll in the GIS Minor at UBC.</p>
        <p>After a while, I found out the reason the grass hadn’t been cut was because Bernard had an issue with his heart. It wasn’t a life-threatening issue, but still, anything to do with the heart is very serious. He had undergone an operation and was having another one soon (which thankfully, he later told me went well!). He was incredibly calm about it, but the fact that he was dealing with this made his generosity to me even more meaningful.</p>
        </>,
        <>
        <img src="alagna/12-1.jpg"/>
        <p>From Bernard’s house I was heading to Namur, a city he had spoken highly of. But first, I received one final gift: a large breakfast. In the end, I got treated to even more than I would have at an Airbnb! I felt very indebted, and couldn’t thank him enough. I told him that if he ever planned to visit Vancouver, he should send me a message on WhatsApp. Hopefully, one day that will happen, and I’ll be able to return the favour.</p>
        <img src="alagna/12-2.jpg"/>
        <p>Namur was indeed a very nice place. It was the perfect size, in my opinion – small enough that it felt warm and welcoming, but large enough that it also felt lively. There was a citadel which overlooked the city, so I decided to bike up there. It was a short, steep, and epic climb. At the top, I was rewarded with a spectacular view of the city and the rolling hills in the distance. These hills were part of the vast Ardennes forest, which I would begin to cross later today.</p>
        <img src="alagna/12-3.jpg"/>
        <p> I followed the Meuse River out of Namur, and for a while after. This was a fantastic stretch. The setting was beautiful, and I was in high spirits following my stay at Bernard’s. But the cherry on top was that here, I finally put an end to my bike’s squeaking. The culprit ended up being a loose bolt on the rack. I didn’t actually think it would help when I tightened it, but it completely did – the noise must have been the rack rubbing against the frame. I can’t overstate how relieved I felt afterwards. It was so nice to have my bike sounding normal again.</p>
        <img src="alagna/12-4.jpg"/>
        <p>Eventually, I left the Meuse and headed into the Ardennes. It began with a slow, steady climb through a forested section. After that, things opened up and the hills commenced. But the inclines were honestly quite mild; there were even some flat stretches. I breezed through the afternoon, still riding on the high from recent events. I was far from being out of the Ardennes, though, and tomorrow there’d be even bigger hills.</p>
        <img src="alagna/12-5.jpg"/>
        <p>Another garden had been secured. Tonight, my host’s name was Hugues. This experience was along the lines of what I had originally expected from WTMG: I arrived, had a quick chat, and then was shown to the garden. Still, I appreciated it a lot. Hugues was a nice, polite guy. He told me his son had biked around the world, which was pretty damn inspiring. The garden itself was gigantic – more like a field, to be honest. I slept peacefully.</p>
        </>,
        <>
        <img src="alagna/13-1.jpg"/>
        <p>After thanking Hugues, I was on my way again. Today, I was cycling a section that Bernard had singled out as especially nice, and he was correct. Everything here, especially the villages, felt very laid back. The weather was also finally changing for the better, although the nights and early mornings were still quite chilly. This morning in particular, I remember that it was something like -2°C — probably the coldest morning of the entire trip. I was wearing every single layer of clothing I had. Thankfully, it warmed up fast once the sun was out. </p>
        <img src="alagna/13-2.jpg"/>
        <p>I stopped for lunch in what became my favourite village in all of Belgium: La Roche-en-Ardenne. It was in a truly beautiful spot — nestled away between steep, forested hills,  and on the bend of a small river. I was also a big fan of the medieval vibe it had going on. This was mainly created by the giant, hilltop castle that overlooked the village, but most of the houses were also of a medieval style. Highly recommend it.</p>

        <p>Immediately after La Roche, the day’s climbing started. The first part was on this forest road, which was completely deserted — it actually felt similar to the British Columbian wilderness at times. I eventually emerged from the trees, but my ascent continued through fields and farmland. This was definitely a tougher day than yesterday; still, I took care of it. I think having the Alps ahead was helpful for my mentality. If I was going to stand a chance there, I had to treat these hills as little warm-ups.</p>

        <p>By evening, there were no gardens within a reasonable distance, so I stealth camped instead. As I closed out on my time in Belgium, I also closed out on my time with WTMG (I did attempt to use it again — more on that later). With how well it was going, I probably should have continued; I did miss the excitement and adventurousness of stealth camping, though. Anyway, it was a major highlight of the trip and provided some wonderful memories. Someday, I hope to have my own garden, which I can offer to other “slow travelers” and repay the kindness that was shown to me.</p>

        <p>After getting through the final few kilometres of Belgium, I crossed the border into Luxembourg in the mid-morning. I wasn’t expecting tons of changes, but nevertheless, it was exciting. Luxembourg (at least to me) is a country that doesn’t really get a lot of attention, so I was quite curious about what it had to offer. I was also just happy that I could now say I had been there.</p>

        <p>I was out of the Ardennes now, and that meant a more relaxed day. The scenery had also opened up—I could often see far into the distance across the broad, gently-sloping hills. Cycling in Luxembourg was fantastic. I split the day between bike paths and backroads, but the latter were so smooth it felt like I was on a bike path anyway. More generally, the country was extremely clean; it reminded me of Switzerland in that sense. Another way it reminded me of Switzerland was the prices. This was not a cheap place to live.</p>
	    <img src="alagna/14-3.jpg"/>
        <p>Wealth was on full display in Luxembourg (City), which I reached in the late afternoon. I think that place had the highest concentration of BMWs, Mercedes, and Audis I have ever seen. There was also something a bit artificial about it. Don’t get me wrong, the city was very aesthetically pleasing, with elegant architecture and plenty of green spaces. But it was almost too clean, and I felt it lacked the character, or individuality, that many major cities have. I might have just been bitter after being charged 4 euros for a coffee, though.</p>
	    <p>On that note, many times during this trip I suffered from trying to be frugal. Not only was I constantly wary about overspending (and would get upset if I did), but sometimes, my money-saving decisions had damaging effects on morale. One such case was tonight’s dinner. I could have chosen a restaurant in the centre of Luxembourg, but having seen the prices of things here, that was not going to happen. Instead, I ended up eating fast food at a shopping mall on the city’s outskirts. It was a dreary experience.</p>
	    <img src="alagna/14-4.jpg"/>
        <p>I’d had enough of the city and continued on eastward. I actually made some decent ground and had just reached a large section of forest when darkness began to fall. That was perfect timing—one of the smoothest stealth camps of the trip followed. I felt like I had mastered the art. Tomorrow night, however, would prove me terribly wrong.</p>

        <p>The day began with traversing some hills in the eastern part of Luxembourg. Before the trip, I had looked at the elevation profile of the route to identify hilly areas; somehow, this stretch went undetected. Therefore, I was not mentally prepared, and got my ass handed to me. On the plus side, though, it was a truly peaceful environment; everyone was still asleep. I also received a few beautiful vistas for my efforts.</p>
	    <img src="alagna/15-2.jpg"/>
        <p>Luxembourg went by in a flash; a mere 24 hours after I had first arrived, I was already in Germany, on the banks of the Mosel. Up to now, my plan had been to follow this river northeast all the way to the city of Koblenz, then turn south onto the Rhine. But due to a variety of reasons, including concerns about stealth camping feasibility, I made the on-the-fly decision to scrap that plan and instead follow yet another river—the Saar—south into France. The downside of this was that I significantly reduced my time in Germany.</p>
	    <img src="alagna/15-3.jpg"/>
        <p>It had actually been a while since I’d last done an extended stint along a river, and it was a welcome change. The highlight of the day was Saarburg—a quaint, riverside town that was made special by a waterfall directly in its centre. Everything was decidedly German, from the style of buildings to the restaurants to the traditional brass band performing in the open. Also, it was all made nicer by another day of blue skies. Summer had fully announced itself by now. </p>
	    <img src="alagna/15-4.jpg"/>
        <p>The rest of the day went by smoothly, and by sundown, I had made some decent progress southward. However, I was now about to experience the single most disastrous night of the entire trip. The area I found myself in—a narrow, densely populated valley—was new to me in terms of stealth camping. As I would soon find out, these are very difficult conditions: flat, unoccupied land is virtually non-existent. </p>
	    <p>In a repeat of my first stealth camping attempt, I searched up and down for hours before abandoning the effort in favour of a hotel. The trouble was that tonight, all hotels in the area were full. Here, my parents—who could see my location—called me to ask what was going on. After updating them, I reserved a hotel online in a town a ways off, and began going there. I messaged my parents to confirm. But I never thought to call the hotel and verify that they had space. My mom did, and the answer she received was no; I was back to square one. </p>
	    <p>I should mention that it was almost midnight at this point, and I had usually been falling asleep at around 9:00 PM. Therefore, in an exhausted and somewhat crazed state, I made a bold decision: I set up camp in the entrance to the town’s football pitch. I figured that since it was so late, no one would be coming around. Well, I was wrong. First, I believe I overheard a drug deal—two cars pulled in, there was talking for a few minutes, and suddenly, both left. Then, just as I had started to decompress from that, a group of youths showed up and settled themselves down about 10 metres away from me. </p>
	    <p>This group stayed for maybe 45 minutes—the longest 45 minutes of my life. I was frozen stiff, dreading the inevitable approach and whatever would follow. But it never happened. Since I can’t understand German, I don’t know if they saw me and just left me alone, or if I was genuinely undetected. The latter wasn’t completely out of the question—I was in a dark corner atop a flight of stairs, and they seemed to be at the bottom. If I truly stayed hidden, then that easily goes into the Global Stealth Camping Hall Of Fame. When they finally left, it took another hour for my adrenaline to wear off, at which point I crashed instantly. </p>

        <p>We're smiling at the start here, but this was a brutal day. It rained for about 90% of our time on the road, and I made things worse for myself with a couple of foolish errors. The first was a lack of gloves. 20 minutes in and my hands had completely frozen, to the point where I couldn't even pull my brakes. Michael insisted I take his gloves, while he improvised with the sleeves of his puffer jacket. He was already saving my ass.</p> 
        
        <p>Eventually we reached a store where I bought some gloves, and then forgot my wallet on the counter. Unbelievable! Miraculously, I realized only about 5 minutes after we had left. But that entire time had been spent bombing downhill, and also it was now <i>really</i> pouring. At this point adrenaline took over and I just went back for it as fast as possible. In hindsight, this was not a smart move; I completely exhausted myself getting that wallet.</p> 

        <p>The blunders stopped after this, but the rain did not. Cycling while being soaked is a very draining and demoralizing activity, and we were doing it for hours. By the end of the day, I was in a really bad state. I had pushed myself way too hard, and that would come back to bite me very soon.</p>

        <p>Compared to the disaster that preceded it, this day was a complete 180. The sun was out, which was very welcome, and everything felt calm. We rolled through the Italian countryside into Turin, where we had an evening Flixbus to catch. This was something we had planned in advance, in the interest of time. It took care of a mountain range as well.</p>   
        
        <p>We got off the bus in Imperia, right on the Mediterranean Sea. By that point it was dark, and we executed a flawless stealth camp right on the coast to end the day. Sadly, and unknown to me at the time, this would be the only time I used my tent on this tour.</p>

        <p>We left our campsite early and began a beautiful ride along the Mediterranean. The turquoise water was in full force. And most of the Italian section was on a bike path, which was fantastic. Although there was one point where it suddenly stopped and we had to walk across a beach…</p>

        <p>After crossing into France, it got quite a bit trafficky at times. This was especially the case around Monaco, and as a result, we zoomed through there. Didn’t even stop at the Monte Carlo, which I kind of regret. Still, another tiny country crossed off the list!</p> 

        <p>In the second half of the day I started to feel some pain in the outside of my left knee. Like a fool, I ignored it and kept going. Unsurprisingly it became worse, and when we arrived at our hotel in Nice, I discovered it was painful to walk. Not a good sign.</p>

        <p>My knee seemed to have improved overnight so we continued on. That went fine for about 30 kilometres, and then the pain returned worse than ever. I threw in the towel at Cannes. I was super bummed out, even more so because I had been really enjoying the day up to that point.</p>

        <p>The issue was that unlike my previous knee injury, this one was aggravated by cycling. I should have gone to see a specialist, but we were really pressed for time. So I decided to just give it some rest. Eventually though, it became clear that this wasn’t something that would disappear in a day or two. I ended up taking trains for the rest of the trip while Michael continued on bike, and we would meet up in cities like Avignon and Lyon.</p>

        <p>I tried making the most of it, but it’s tough not to view this tour as a major disappointment. I got so carried away with excitement and the idea of “big days” that I completely ignored the matter of conditioning. Part of me honestly didn’t think I needed to train, and in that regard the experience was very humbling. Afterwards, I was determined to learn from my mistakes and not let this happen again.</p>
