        <p> Me and my bike had landed at Gatwick the day before. I don't think I can truly express how legendary it felt to pedal out of the airport and straight into the countryside. It was honestly one of the best moments of the trip. But I was now in the town of Redhill, the official starting point of my journey. (Yes, I know "London" is stretching it, but it sounds better than “Redhill to Alagna”)</p>
        <p> In true UK fashion, it rained for most of the day. It wasn’t heavy rain, and there were breaks, but it was certainly persistent. At one point I ended up seeking shelter in a pub, where I enjoyed a national specialty: fish and chips and mushy peas. Top stuff.</p>
        <p> I was keen to get the camping going immediately, but the weather, as well as my jet lag, made me reconsider. I ended up staying at a hotel. </p>

        <p>Feeling well rested, I got into my second day on the road. The rain had ceased, and now I was really able to take in the classic British countryside. There were a couple hills early on, but I shifted into a low gear and made fairly light work of them. It helped that I was on some incredibly peaceful roads with hardly any cars. I could keep calm and just focus on the climb.</p>

        <p>My route so far had contained occasional sections of unpaved forest trails. As I approached another forest in the afternoon, I was ready to get back on the dirt. But for whatever reason, this particular trail was severely mudded. At first I was able to skirt around the bad sections, but it eventually became unavoidable. By the time I got out I had accumulated a thick layer of mud on both my tires, and some on the bike’s frame as well.</p>

        <p>A while after, I found myself on another dirt path, pedalling uphill. As I ascended, the view opened up into a sweeping panorama of the coast. And suddenly I was surrounded by sheep! I was cutting straight through a series of pastures. This stretch was genuinely epic. The photo doesn’t do it justice. It and the muddy forest probably made up about 5 kilometres combined, but they added a such an unexpected, adventurous twist to the day.</p>

        <p>And before I knew it, I was already on a ferry to France, saying goodbye to the UK. It’s a shame I couldn’t stay longer; time constraints were the main factor preventing that. I hope to go back one day. I would especially like to cycle in Wales.</p>

        <p>I was now in the French port of Dieppe, where I would begin my venture into mainland Europe. From here on out, English could not be safely relied upon. And as I ordered my first croissant, I realized that my already poor, high-school level of French had deteriorated quite a bit. Anyway, I liked Dieppe. It wasn’t picturesque, but it still had a certain charm.</p>
        <img src="alagna/3-2.jpg"/>
        <p>I was following the coast for the next little while. It was dotted with several sleepy villages, and in between were farmers’ fields. As soon as I got out of Dieppe, there was practically no one else on the road. It was so peaceful. And now that I was in France, navigation was a breeze - the route was signposted at almost every intersection.</p>  
        <img src="alagna/3-3.jpg"/>
        <p>I reached the town of Mers-les-Bains at around 5:30 pm (I had started late). My plan was to have dinner here, then push on and find a spot to stealth camp. What ensued was a giant waste of time and energy. I searched for the next three hours or so, without success. The landscape wasn’t the best - lots of open fields and not much tree cover. But there was undoubtedly a mental barrier as well. I started worrying about what-ifs when I needed to just toughen up and get the tent down. It’s a difficult thing to do though, especially at the start.</p>
        <p>Eventually it got dark, started raining, and to top it all off I stepped in a mysterious sludgy substance while investigating a potential spot. That was the last straw. Despite the amount of searching I had done, I had never gotten too far from Mers-les-Bains. So I headed back there and checked into the cheapest hotel I could find. Exhausted and dejected by the whole experience, I started to doubt whether I was truly capable of wild camping on this trip.</p>

        <p>A good night’s sleep had revived me following last night’s disaster, and I was now more determined than ever to successfully camp. But first, there was a whole day of cycling to get through. Today’s conditions weren't amazing; the sky was completely grey, and it was raining on and off. Although this created a moody atmosphere which, in my opinion, fit the scenery quite well.</p>
        <img src="alagna/4-2.jpg"/>
        <p>After cycling inland for a bit, I popped back out on the water at the town of Cayeux-sur-Mer. This place was completely deserted. Apparently it’s a resort town, so that probably explains why. It was a horrible day for a beach vacation. I continued along the coast for a while, and it began to remind me of Iona Beach, my favourite ride to do back in Vancouver. It was bizarre - I felt so far away from there, but at the same time, very close.</p>  
        <img src="alagna/4-3.jpg"/>
        <p>Later on I reached a town called Saint-Valery-sur-Somme. Here there were actually signs of life, which was comforting, but it was also just a very nice, quaint town. This marked the point where I would officially leave the coast and start heading up the Somme: the first of many rivers my route followed.</p>
        <p>And at last, I was able to get the tent down. Once again, I spent multiple hours searching. But this time, I eventually gathered the courage and committed to a spot. I’m not revealing the exact location; I’ll just say that it was inside of a bush, in what I wouldn’t exactly call an unpopulated area. So, not the smoothest operation... That didn’t matter though! I had overcome the intimidating mental hurdle and proven to myself that this was in fact doable.</p>

        <p>Stealth camping is a challenging, often uncomfortable activity. But when you get to cycle away the next morning, knowing that you’ve pulled it off… it's just an awesome feeling. I’d describe it as a mixture of relief and triumph. So, I was refreshed and eager to tackle the day. Unfortunately though, it started to rain just as I was packing up, and I had to stop to dry out my tent at the first opportunity. This would actually become a daily occurrence; not because of rain, but simply due to condensation that would form overnight.</p>
        <img src="alagna/5-2.jpg"/>
        <p>It was another serene day of cycling, which I spent entirely on a towpath alongside the Somme. The river around here was extremely slow-moving, and looked more like a marsh at times. What I remember most was the constant chirping of birds. Not in an annoying way though - in fact, quite the opposite. It was like one of those nature relaxation recordings.</p>  
        <img src="alagna/5-3.jpg"/>
        <p>I was in Amiens by the late afternoon. This was the biggest city I had reached so far, and I tried to spend some time checking it out. But it just wasn’t that enjoyable. For me (and I would realize this later), cities are not great when I’m on the bike. For one, I’m quite paranoid about theft, so any attraction that requires me to leave my bike is a no-go. Then, I’m also usually pretty tired from cycling, and navigating through cities can be really stressful. So, I’ve realized the best move if I want to stop in a city is to book a hotel and explore it on foot.</p>
        <img src="alagna/5-4.jpg"/>
        <p>To close out the day, I executed another stealth camp; this time a lot more cleanly. I had gotten far enough from Amiens that it was dead quiet again, and I was able to easily find a secluded spot close to the bike path. To my surprise, I wasn’t finding it difficult to fall asleep. The whole thing was still nerve-wracking, definitely, but once it got dark and I was in my tent, I was out pretty quick. I think I was just that exhausted.</p>

        <p>We're smiling at the start here, but this was a brutal day. It rained for about 90% of our time on the road, and I made things worse for myself with a couple of foolish errors. The first was a lack of gloves. 20 minutes in and my hands had completely frozen, to the point where I couldn't even pull my brakes. Michael insisted I take his gloves, while he improvised with the sleeves of his puffer jacket. He was already saving my ass.</p> 
        
        <p>Eventually we reached a store where I bought some gloves, and then forgot my wallet on the counter. Unbelievable! Miraculously, I realized only about 5 minutes after we had left. But that entire time had been spent bombing downhill, and also it was now <i>really</i> pouring. At this point adrenaline took over and I just went back for it as fast as possible. In hindsight, this was not a smart move; I completely exhausted myself getting that wallet.</p> 

        <p>The blunders stopped after this, but the rain did not. Cycling while being soaked is a very draining and demoralizing activity, and we were doing it for hours. By the end of the day, I was in a really bad state. I had pushed myself way too hard, and that would come back to bite me very soon.</p>

        <p>Compared to the disaster that preceded it, this day was a complete 180. The sun was out, which was very welcome, and everything felt calm. We rolled through the Italian countryside into Turin, where we had an evening Flixbus to catch. This was something we had planned in advance, in the interest of time. It took care of a mountain range as well.</p>   
        
        <p>We got off the bus in Imperia, right on the Mediterranean Sea. By that point it was dark, and we executed a flawless stealth camp right on the coast to end the day. Sadly, and unknown to me at the time, this would be the only time I used my tent on this tour.</p>

        <p>We left our campsite early and began a beautiful ride along the Mediterranean. The turquoise water was in full force. And most of the Italian section was on a bike path, which was fantastic. Although there was one point where it suddenly stopped and we had to walk across a beach…</p>

        <p>After crossing into France, it got quite a bit trafficky at times. This was especially the case around Monaco, and as a result, we zoomed through there. Didn’t even stop at the Monte Carlo, which I kind of regret. Still, another tiny country crossed off the list!</p> 

        <p>In the second half of the day I started to feel some pain in the outside of my left knee. Like a fool, I ignored it and kept going. Unsurprisingly it became worse, and when we arrived at our hotel in Nice, I discovered it was painful to walk. Not a good sign.</p>

        <p>My knee seemed to have improved overnight so we continued on. That went fine for about 30 kilometres, and then the pain returned worse than ever. I threw in the towel at Cannes. I was super bummed out, even more so because I had been really enjoying the day up to that point.</p>

        <p>The issue was that unlike my previous knee injury, this one was aggravated by cycling. I should have gone to see a specialist, but we were really pressed for time. So I decided to just give it some rest. Eventually though, it became clear that this wasn’t something that would disappear in a day or two. I ended up taking trains for the rest of the trip while Michael continued on bike, and we would meet up in cities like Avignon and Lyon.</p>

        <p>I tried making the most of it, but it’s tough not to view this tour as a major disappointment. I got so carried away with excitement and the idea of “big days” that I completely ignored the matter of conditioning. Part of me honestly didn’t think I needed to train, and in that regard the experience was very humbling. Afterwards, I was determined to learn from my mistakes and not let this happen again.</p>
